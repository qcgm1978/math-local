**What is a difference between deep learning and task-specific algorithms?**

Parameters Deep learning (also known as deep structured learning or hierarchical learning) is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on learning data representations, as opposed to task-specific algorithms.

function add(x, y) { // x and y are parameters
  return x + y;
}

Arguments are variables passed down to a function in place of parameters.

add(2, 3); // arguments
